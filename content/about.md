# My name is Christos Panagiotakopoulos

I'm a self-proclaimed software craftsman with a 5-year experience in Node.js.

I'm currently building decentralized discourse, as a Software Engineer, at [Capsule Social](https://capsule.social), while exploring the potential of the Decentralized Web.

I'm currently finishing my CS studies at the [School of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) of the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/).

In my free time, I play greek rembetiko music on the guitar and administrate the [rembetiko.gr](https://rembetiko.gr) community.

From time to time you can read some of my thoughts, projects and ideas that I share on [my blog](/posts).
